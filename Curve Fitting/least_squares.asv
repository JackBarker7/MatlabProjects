function [a,b, rms] = least_squares(xarr,yarr)
%least_squares Returns coefficients after performing least squares
%regression on the input arrays
%   xarr and yarr should be input arrays of data
%	returns coefficients a and b for the fit line y=a+bx, as well as the
%	rms value for the data set
	
	%we first need to find the matrices Xmat and Ymat in the equation 
	%Xmat*amat = Ymat
	Xmat = len
