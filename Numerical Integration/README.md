Performs numerical integration using Simpson's Rule.

Numerical integration is performed on the functions defined in `erf_integral.m` and `erf_sin_integral.m`. 

Functions are e^{-x^2} and sin{100Ï€x}\*e^{-x^2} respectively.

Compares answers, using different step sizes, to Matlab's `erf()` and `integral()` functions.
